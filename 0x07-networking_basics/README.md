1. The name of a network interface
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. A network interface
#### What is an IP address? ####
1. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

#### Which statement is correct for the TCP box: ####
1. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
2. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
#### Which statement is correct for the UDP box: ####
1. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
2. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
#### Which statement is correct for the TCP worker: ####
1. `Have you received boxes x, y, z?`
2. `May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?`


### [4. TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.

If we continue the comparison of a network device to your house, where IP address is like your postal address, UDP and TCP ports are like the windows and doors of your place. A TCP/UDP network device has 65535 ports. Some of them are officially reserved for a specific usage, some of them are known to be used for a specific usage (but nothing is officially declared) and the rest are free of use.

While the full list of ports should not be memorized, it is important to know the most used ports, letâ€™s start by remembering 3 of them:

* __22__ for SSH
* __80__ for HTTP
* __443__ for HTTPS
Note that a specific `IP + port = socket`.

Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

* That only shows listening sockets
* That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
Example:

```

### [5. Is the host on the network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

* Accepts a string as an argument
* Displays `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed
* Ping the IP 5 times
Example:

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=12.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=13.6 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=7.83 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=11.3 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=63 time=7.57 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4006ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.570/10.682/13.679/2.546 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network
Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
