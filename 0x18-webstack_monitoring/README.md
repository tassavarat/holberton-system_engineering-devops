### [1. Monitor some metrics](./0-setup_datadog)
Among the litany of data your monitoring service can report to you are system metrics. You can use these metrics to determine statistics such as reads/writes per second, which can help your company determine if/how they should scale. Set up some monitors within the Datadog dashboard to monitor and alert you of a few. You can read about the various system metrics that you can monitor here: System Check.

* Set up a monitor that checks the number of read requests issued to the device per second.
* Set up a monitor that checks the number of write requests issued to the device per second.

### [2. Create a dashboard](./2-setup_datadog)
Now create a dashboard with different metrics displayed in order to get a few different visualizations.

* Create a new dashboard
* Add at least 4 widgets to your dashboard. They can be of any type and monitor whatever you’d like
* Create the answer file 2-setup_datadog which has the dashboard_id on the first line. Note: in order to get the id of your dashboard, you may need to use [Datadog’s API](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/VrzQP39UUFMmAKZx0IZLuw)
